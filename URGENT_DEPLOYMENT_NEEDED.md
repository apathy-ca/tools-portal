# URGENT: Deployment Required to Remove Rate Limiting

## Current Status
The rate limiting removal changes have been committed to both repositories, but the containers are still running the old version with rate limiting enabled.

**Evidence**: HTTP response headers still show:
- `x-ratelimit-limit: 10`
- `x-ratelimit-remaining: 0`
- `retry-after: 47`
- Status `429` (Too Many Requests)

## Required Action
There are uncommitted changes that need to be handled first, then rebuild containers:

```bash
cd ~/tools-portal

# Check what changes exist
git status

# Update the submodule to latest commit (with rate limiting removal)
cd tools/dns-by-eye
git pull origin main
cd ..

# Clean up any untracked files in the submodule
cd tools/dns-by-eye
git clean -fd
cd ../..

# Add the submodule update (this should now work)
git add tools/dns-by-eye

# Check if nginx config changes are needed, if not restore
git restore nginx-tools-ssl.conf

# Remove backup file
rm -f nginx-tools-ssl.conf.bak

# Now commit the submodule update
git commit -m "Update DNS By Eye submodule to latest with rate limiting removal"

# Push the changes
git push origin main

# Now rebuild containers with the latest changes
sudo docker compose -f docker-compose-tools-ssl.yaml down
sudo docker compose -f docker-compose-tools-ssl.yaml up -d --build
```

## What This Will Fix
After deployment, the rate limiting will be completely removed:
- ✅ No more `429 Too Many Requests` errors
- ✅ No more `x-ratelimit-*` headers
- ✅ Unlimited consecutive DNS analyses
- ✅ No blocking of static assets (favicon, logo)

## Verification
After deployment, test a DNS analysis and check that:
1. No `429` status codes are returned
2. No `x-ratelimit-*` headers in response
3. Multiple consecutive analyses work without restriction

## Changes Applied (Already Committed)
- ✅ Rate limiter initialization commented out
- ✅ All `@limiter.limit()` decorators removed from API endpoints
- ✅ Graph generation fixes (7-day cleanup, unique filenames)
- ✅ Docker variable substitution fixes

**The code changes are ready - just need container restart to take effect.**
