# This file preserves settings between generate-compose.py runs

# Bind IP setting - uncomment and set your preferred IP
# To stop the script from defaulting to 192.168.14.24, set your desired IP here:
# BIND_IP=192.168.1.100

# Example configurations:
# BIND_IP=10.0.0.50      # For virtual IP
# BIND_IP=192.168.1.100  # For specific network interface
# BIND_IP=127.0.0.1      # For localhost only
# BIND_IP=0.0.0.0        # For all interfaces (explicit)
# Leave commented for all interfaces (default behavior)

# NOTE: If you were getting 192.168.14.24 automatically, it was likely from:
# - A previous command line argument being cached somewhere
# - An environment variable being set
# - Running the script from a different location
# This config file now ensures your preference is preserved.
